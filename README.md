I chose to redesign the Ítalía resturant website. 
I added comments to the design so you can see what the thought was. 
I wanted to make the design to look modern and attractive to those who are planning a place to go to dinner. 
I used and recommend these plugins: Unsplash(for all photos), iconify (for all icons) and A11y color contrast checker (Just to check, trust your own instincts if you think that the contrast is not good). There are also a lot of fun plugins to check out in figma :) 


Let the design breath: I used plenty of whitespace in my design to give it some breathingspace. Even when I thought I had enough whitespace, I added more. It also makes the page looks modern, simpler and easier to navigate

Alignment: I mostly used Centered and then left align. Where there's text that's not only header I made it left aligned. Examples of that is mainly on the about page. You can take a look at the gray border there, even the buttons are to the left. That creates more balance. On the main page you can both see centered and left. As I mentioned, I left aligned text if there was more text than just header. Below the three photos I thought it looked better to have the text there centered to keep the balance. 

Contrast in elements and color: My text and colors are easily readable regarding to contrast. The only that could get me in trouble is that I have text over images on both pages. The reserve a table on the main page is white set on a dark background. The container that it's in also has a little bit of black opacatiy just in case. The 'About us' on the About page is white on both dark and light background. I added dropshadow to make the text pop, and I think it worked! 

Color pallette: My color pallette is simple; white, black and gray. I tried to make the images on the site have the same mood to them. Of course that's kind of a challange when you're using Unsplash but I think it makes a good whole. 

Scale/Visual hierarchy: Visual Hierarchy is used to guide the user to what's important. I made the headers bigger and the font is bolder. 

Use of typography: I used two fonts through out the design: Bebas Neue and Montserrat. I think these two fonts are a good pair. The Bebas Neue is bolder, all uppercase and stands out. While the Monterrat is smaller and lighter. I used it in normal weight for this. I think both fonts have a modern vibe to them, both sans serif. 

Rule of odds: I used rule of odds on the Main page - the three photos of dishes and description below them. Images are more appealing to the eye in odd numbers. 

I tried to organize my layers on figma well so it should be easy to navigate through them if you want. 

I tried my best to stay concistant with the design, break up the symmetry, create balance and a nice design 


All comments, good or bad, are welcome! :D
